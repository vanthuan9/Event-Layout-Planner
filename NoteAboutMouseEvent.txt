Every mouse operation takes a mouse movement

App.js: already event handler for the mouse
	2(event.clientX / width) - 1 
	and -2(clientY / height) + 1
	this.scene.mouseClicked or onMouseDown method
		pass event onto scene
		check where the mouse press happended on the virtual world
			covered in ppt slide
		multiply with the cameraProjMatrix inversed
			(thuan-not just the regular?)
			vec2 -> vec4 - mouse coordinate normalize device space
				mccNdc.mul()
		mc.minus(gameObject.pos).length() < set-width
Mouse movement:
	event.movementX and event.movementY

We can make the small tweaks to the control
